This folder is organised in different sections

* Articles: Various papers relevant to the thesis.
* code: All the code used to generate the data, train the network, conduct experiments, and process the experiement results.
* ct_atrium: The CT scans used to generate the datasets. They have not been uploaded unto Github as the information is private.
* datasets: Directory where all the generated datasets are located. These are generated locally using scripts stored in ../code/dataset_generation and not uploaded unto Github due to the size of the resulting HDF5 files.
* experimental results: Where all the experimental results are stored in folders with self-explanatory names indicating the nature of the experiments conducted.
* Thesis Report: Final master's thesis.
