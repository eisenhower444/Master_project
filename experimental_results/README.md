# Experimental Results

All the experiments are launched from Master's_Thesis/code/experiments/run_experiment.py. There names indicate the type of experiment conducted.

## Organisation of each experiment

Each experiment consist of a number of folders denoting particular type of variation that was done to either the architecture or the training parameters:

* model.net: final model serialised in torch
* training_parameters.json: the model and training parameters in json format
* model_*.lua: lua file containing the architecture used which was generated from a template file in code/CNN/model_templates
* train.log, test.log: text files containing a list of the overall classification rate on the training and testing datasets at the end of each epoch.
* predicted_labels_*: HDF5 files generated by ../code/CNN/segment.lua containing the predicted labels on the segmentation images in ../datasets/segmentation_datatsets/segmentation_dataset_*.hdf5
