# Experimental Results

All the experiments are launched from Master's_Thesis/code/experiments/run_experiments. There names indicate the type of experiment conducted.

## Organisation of each experiment

Each experiment consist of a number of numbered folders denoting the index of the experiment containing the following files:

* model.net: final model serialised in torch
* model_parameters.json, training_parameters.json: the model and training parameters in json format
* train.log, test.log: text files containing a list of the dice coefficients on the training and testing sets at the end of each epoch.
* predicted_labels.hdf5: HDF5 file generated by ../code/CNN/segment.lua containing the predicted labels on the segmentation images in ../datasets/segmentation_datatsets
* image_fixed_[x,y,z].png: RGB masks of the segmentation images denoting correctly classified pixels in the non-Atrium, Atrium and non-correctly classified pixels in red, green and blue respectively.
